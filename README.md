# NN-Practice-Snippets

This is a repo to store the files for the Neural Networks I use to learn how to make Neural Networks. Most of these python files will be me following a tutorial or two
but there might be a few that I upload that are from me playing around with how they are made. 

File        | Tutorial/Not tutorial  | Status
NN.py       | Tutorial               | On hold due to school.
